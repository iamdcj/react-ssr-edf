Project boilerplate intended for use with EDF SDLTridion powered React applications,

### Features

The base application contains the following built-in features;

‚úÖ Server Side Rendered

üê≥ [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

üÉè [Unit Testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html)

üìï [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

üíÖüèª [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

### Core Technologies

## Getting Started

The following sections will help you get the application up-and-running.

### Installation

1. Install Dependencies `yarn` or `npm install`

2. Generate environment variables `[yarn | npm] dotenvi -s <[local, development, production]>`

### Running the Application

Run application for _development_ or _production_:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the application using the configuration defined in `.env`.

## Components

Please refer to following sections when developing components.

### Setup

All presentation components should respect the following convention upon creation:

- `PascalCased` directory, containing:
  - `index.[j|t]s` file which exports default from the chosen `.[j|t]sx` file.
  - One or more `.[j|t]sx` component files.

Example:

```
MyComponent/index.js
```

```
MyComponent/my-component.jsx
```

The usage of the index file is in place to better facilitate unit tests, and [bitsrc](https://bitsrc.io) integration.

All other component files and directories should use `lisp-casing`.

### Testing

### Best Practices

Please respect following conventions when creating components:

#### 'Null' Checks

_Always_ check for presence of data before referencing.

```
<h2>{title}</h2>
```

```
{ title && <h1>{title}</h1> }
```

Optional Chaining is available for use in the build, please **do the right thing**.

### State

Please use [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) where possible; I'm not against using `class`es with lifecycle methods, but most component state can easily be sorted using hooks.

### Markup Conventions

Please ensure semantic markup is used throughout when developing components.

### Styling

The application is configured to utilise [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).
